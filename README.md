# computeStringExpression
x86 Assembly

Evaluate string expressions. 
It accepts +,-,/,* operators. 

A bug is that it doesn't evaluate the expression when the final operator is * or / (2+3*6=).
Also, I have not implemented yet support for "*x=" or "/x=" string expressions.


  these are examples:

  -> 2+3=
  -> 2-3=
  -> 2*3+1=
  -> 6/3+1=
  -> +2=
  -> -2=
